## About Me

I am a graduate of the Master of Information and Data Science program at UC Berkeley, with a B.S. in Computational and Systems Biology from UCLA. My path into data science began in the life sciences and has since spanned healthcare, insurance, and applied machine learning. Early in my career, I worked as a computational biologist at Neogenomics Laboratories, where I applied statistical and unsupervised learning methods to cellular morphology data, looking for patterns that could inform cancer diagnostics. This experience showed me the power of quantitative methods to uncover hidden insights in complex biological systems.

I later transitioned into data science roles at AIOI Insurance Services, where my focus shifted toward risk modeling, customer segmentation, and predictive analytics. There, I built and deployed models that optimized cross-sell strategies, forecasted claims, and improved retention. Although the domain was different, the core challenge was the same: take messy, real-world data and turn it into tools that drive decision-making. My curiosity about how systems—whether biological, financial, or human—behave and can be modeled is what kept me moving forward.

Along the way, I discovered a deep interest in applied machine learning and large-scale AI systems. During my graduate work at Berkeley, I explored advanced topics such as natural language processing, causal inference, and generative AI. I built a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline for structured search and question answering, and later extended this interest into building an object-detection and assistive-vision system for grocery shopping. That project combined YOLO-based detection, AWS Bedrock multimodal captioning, and iOS CoreML integration to provide real-time audio guidance for visually impaired users—a hands-on demonstration of how AI can augment human capabilities in practical, everyday contexts.

My work now bridges technical depth with applied problem-solving. On one end, I design infrastructure—building data pipelines, deploying containerized models on cloud platforms, and optimizing inference systems for latency and scale. On the other, I stay grounded in the human side of the work: how insights and tools actually help people, whether it’s patients navigating healthcare, customers making financial decisions, or users engaging with AI-driven products.

What unites my trajectory is a persistent curiosity: how do we ask the right questions of data, and how do we design systems that not only answer them but also empower others to act? In my career, I aim to bring together the rigor of statistical reasoning, the scalability of modern machine learning, and a human-centered perspective. I see data science not just as building models, but as shaping the lens through which we understand and improve the world.
